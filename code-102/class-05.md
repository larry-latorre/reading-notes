# Design web pages with CSS

Designing with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a way to make web pages look attractive and well-organized. CSS is a language used in web development to control the visual appearance of web content. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. Select an HTML Element: To start designing with CSS, you first need to select the HTML element you want to style. This could be something like a heading (e.g., `<h1>`), a paragraph (`<p>`), a button (`<button>`), or any other HTML element on your web page.

2. Define the Style: Once you've selected an element, you can define its style by specifying various visual properties. These properties include things like the color, size, font, spacing, and more.

3. Apply Styles: To apply these styles to your selected element, you can use CSS rules. CSS rules consist of a selector (the HTML element you want to style) and a set of style properties and values.

4. Link CSS to HTML: To make your styles work, you need to link your CSS file to your HTML document. You can do this by using the `<link>` element in the HTML's `<head>` section or by including the CSS directly within a `<style>`tag in the HTML file.

5. View in the Browser: After you've created and linked your CSS file, open your HTML document in a web browser. You'll see your chosen elements styled according to the CSS rules you've defined.
