# Revisions To The Cloud

Revisions in the context of cloud computing typically refer to updates or changes made to software, applications, or data stored in the cloud. These revisions can include fixes for software bugs, improvements in functionality, or enhancements to security features.

When developers make changes to the app to make it work better or fix issues, they create a new version of the app. Revisions in the cloud allow for continuous improvement and maintenance of software and data, ensuring that users have access to the most up-to-date and reliable resources.

## What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

## What is cloning in Git?

## What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message:
**git commit -m “made change x,y,z”**

## What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

Next, you would push changes to a remote repository. We will discuss remote repositories in more depth in the next section. For now, we will look at a general overview of pushing changes to remotes.
