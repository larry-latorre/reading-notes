# Programming with JavaScript

Programming with JavaScript is like giving instructions to a computer using a language it understands. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1. **Writing Instructions:** You write commands in JavaScript to tell the computer what to do. These commands are called "code."

2. **Variables:** You can store information in variables, like numbers or text, so the computer can remember and use them later.

3. **Conditions:** You can use "if" statements to make the computer do different things based on certain conditions. For example, "if it's raining, bring an umbrella."

4. **Loops:** You can use loops to make the computer do the same thing multiple times, like a recipe with steps that are repeated.

5. **Functions:** You can group code into functions, like little programs, that you can use again and again.

6. **Events:** You can make things happen when a user interacts with a web page, like clicking a button or filling out a form.

7. **Output:** JavaScript can also show information on a web page, like changing text, images, or colors.

In a nutshell, JavaScript is a tool for creating interactive and dynamic elements on websites, making them more interesting and responsive to user actions. It's a versatile language used in web development to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.

**What is control flow?**

Control Flow is the order in which elements of a computer program - instructions, statements and function calls - are executed and evalutated.

**what is a JavaScript function?**

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**

What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

**What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?**

They are used to contain a list of parameters passed to functions and control structures and they are used to group expressions to control the order of execution.
