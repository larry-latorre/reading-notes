# Structure web pages with HTML

Structuring web pages with HTML is like creating a blueprint for a website. HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a set of instructions that tell web browsers how to display content on a webpage.

In simple terms, HTML helps organize and structure the different parts of a webpage. It uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These tags provide information about what each element is and how it should be displayed. For example, you can use the `<h1>` tag to create a main heading, and `<p>` for paragraphs.

By arranging these HTML elements in a specific way, you can create the layout and content of your webpage. This structure not only helps browsers understand how to present your content but also makes it more accessible and easier to style using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for a visually appealing and user-friendly website.
