## Growth mindset

For me growth mind set is a rewiring of the way we think about learning. By changing the way we approach **challeges, obstacles, effort,criticisms** and how we learn from others.
Some ways I can remind myself to stay in a  growth mindset would be to always:

1. *Persist* no matter what

2. Learn from *criticism*

3. *Embrace* challeges and put in the *effort*
