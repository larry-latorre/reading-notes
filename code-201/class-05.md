Padding
You can add spacing around the characters by setting the padding property for the `<h1>` element. This will add space within the element's boundary, effectively pushing the text away from the edges of the element.

Margin
Another way to add spacing around the characters in an `<h1>` element is by setting the margin property. Unlike padding, which adds space within the element, margin adds space outside the element, effectively controlling the spacing between the `<h1>` element and surrounding elements.
