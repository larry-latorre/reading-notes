# Domain Modeling

**Explain why we need domain modeling.**

Domain modeling is a critical step in the software development process and problem-solving in various domains. It enables a structured, systematic approach to understanding complex problems, clarifying requirements, and building effective solutions while promoting effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

## HTML Table Basics

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

In modern web development, it's advisable to use HTML for content structure and CSS for layout and presentation. This approach adheres to web standards, promotes accessibility, and results in cleaner, more maintainable code that is better suited for today's diverse range of devices and browsers.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.**

1. The `<caption>` element is used to provide a title or a caption for a table. It is typically placed as the first child of the `<table>` element, and it appears above or below the table, depending on the CSS styling.

2. `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`
These elements are used to group table rows into different sections
`<thead>` (Table Header): Typically contains one or more rows of header cells that describe the columns' content.
`<tbody>` (Table Body): Contains the main content of the table, including data rows.
`<tfoot>`(Table Footer): Contains summary or footer information related to the table.
3.`<th>` (Table Header Cell):
 The `<th>` element is used to define header cells within a table. Header cells are typically placed in the first row or first column of a table and represent column or row headings.


### Introducing Constructors

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

 Constructors play a crucial role in object-oriented programming by ensuring that objects are properly initialized and adhere to the principles of encapsulation. They offer advantages such as code reusability, flexibility, validation, and consistency in object creation, making them an essential concept for building maintainable and reliable software.

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
The use of the this keyword in JavaScript can differ when used in an object literal and when used in a constructor function. This difference is related to how this is bound and the context in which it is used.
