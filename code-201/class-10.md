# Debugging

**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.**

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

Syntax errors are related to the code's structure and are detected by the compiler or interpreter, while logic errors involve issues with the program's algorithm or logic and are often detected during or after program execution. Debugging logic errors can be more challenging because they don't necessarily result in immediate error messages.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

Mostly syntax errors.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

Education and Learning: Understanding and effectively dealing with errors in JavaScript is fundamental for web developers and programmers. As JavaScript remains one of the most widely used programming languages for web development, knowing how to identify and fix errors is crucial for success. Continued education and learning about error handling will be a key aspect of a developer's long-term growth.

## The JavaScript Debugger

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

The JavaScript Debugger is a powerful tool that allows you to examine the execution of your JavaScript code step by step. It helps you catch and correct errors (bugs) and gain a deep understanding of how your code behaves. You can use it to track variable values, set breakpoints, and watch the call stack, which shows you the order in which functions are called.

**Define what a breakpoint is.**

A breakpoint is a designated point in a program's source code where execution temporarily pauses, allowing developers to inspect the program's state, variables, and behavior. Breakpoints are used during the debugging process to help identify and fix issues in the code.

**What is the call stack?**

The call stack is a critical data structure in computer science and software development that keeps track of the order in which functions or methods are called and their respective contexts during program execution. It's a fundamental part of how programs manage and keep track of function calls and their associated data.
