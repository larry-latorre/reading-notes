# Text editor vs Coding-specific text editor  VS IDE

## Text Editor

Basic text editors, like Notepad or TextEdit, are simple and lightweight tools designed for general text manipulation. They are suitable for tasks like jotting down notes, drafting emails, or creating simple text documents.

## Coding-specific text editors

Coding-specific text editors, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom, bridge the gap between basic text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs). These editors offer features tailored to coding, such as syntax highlighting, code folding, and plugins/extensions that can be customized to suit specific programming languages and workflows.

## IDE

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA, provide comprehensive toolsets for software development. They include features like code debugging, project management, version control integration, and more, making them ideal for complex coding projects.

### Four important features to look for in a text editor are

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

### Examples of command used in the command line 

* pwd - prints the name of the working directory
* ls - list contents of current directory
* cd - chages your current directory
* mkdir - creates a new directory in the current working directory
* touch - creates a new file in the current working directory

### Example scenario 

1. cd projects - Changes current directory to projects directory
2. mkdir new-project - Creates a new directory named new-projects
3. touch new-project/newfile.md - Creates a file named newfile.md in the new-project directory
4. cd .. - Moves the directory back one directory to projects
5. ls projects/new-project - Lists contents of new-project
